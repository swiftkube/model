	/// CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a given StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular topology segment.  This can be used when considering where to instantiate new PersistentVolumes.
	///
	/// For example this can express things like: - StorageClass "standard" has "1234 GiB" available in "topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1" - StorageClass "localssd" has "10 GiB" available in "kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123"
	///
	/// The following three cases all imply that no capacity is available for a certain combination: - no object exists with suitable topology and storage class name - such an object exists, but the capacity is unset - such an object exists, but the capacity is zero
	///
	/// The producer of these objects can decide which approach is more suitable.
	///
	/// They are consumed by the kube-scheduler if the CSIStorageCapacity beta feature gate is enabled there and a CSI driver opts into capacity-aware scheduling with CSIDriver.StorageCapacity.
